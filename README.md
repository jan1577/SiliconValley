This project was part of the Data Science and Machine Learning Course at Unviersity of Cologne.
The task was to implement a descriptive and predictive analysis for the bike-sharing demand of Metro Bike Share in Los Angeles, California.

## Content

The project is split into 3 parts. 

- Data Cleaning
- Descriptive Analysis
- Predictive Analysis

The Data Cleaning is mostly based on information about the dataset that Metro Bike Share published on their [website](https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/).
The descriptive analysis contains information on bike usage over different periods of time (day, week, year). In addition, different aspects such as fleet utilization and user types are analyzed.
For prediction, KNN and a Decision-Tree model were used.
